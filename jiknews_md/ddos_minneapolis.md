# Hacktivists take down Minneapolis's website to protest Police killing
**by Staff**

Minneapolis is under fire, and so are their servers, suffering DDoS attacks after DDoS attacks to the point where the Minneapolis City Council set up Cloudflare in order to combat these DDoS attacks.

Most of these DDoS attacks are made by people claiming to be members of Anonymous on Twitter. This isn't the first time a Police killing let to DDoS attacks and it certainly won't be the last, perhaps it's just the beginning for the Minneapolis government. 

However, skeptics say that these DDoS attacks simply come from a large number of people visiting the website in order to get information.

The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department led to deadly riots around the city, the city is constantly under fire and shops are constantly being looted, a 21st century edition of the LA Riots.

~~Minneapolis City Council did not want to comment.~~ City of Minneapolis released a statement confirming that they had been DDoSed and that they suffered a "substantial cyberattack"
