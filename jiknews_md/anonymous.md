# Anonymania...
**by CHT & resolv**

Anonymous' name has been brought up a lot during these riots, due to their *DDoSing and stuff*
Anonymous isn't one skiddie, it is a collective of skiddies in their goal to constantly be in the spotlight using current events and talent.


Here is what they have done:
## DDoSed some government websites
Nowadays, its *very*, **very**, ***very***, ***VERY*** easy to take a website down with free stressers (such as quez)

People with barely any hacking skills can take any site down thanks to these stressers.
## Played "Fuck Tha Police" on the Police Radio
They also played "[Remove Kebab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remove_Kebab)", a very peaceful and non-racist song, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJBgRW6XKPM). 

Now, this requires more skill, but not **that much** skill, anyone with a radio transmitter can hijack police radio frequencies.
## Leaked classified Courtroom files!
Accessing PACER is not leaking. It costs about 10 dollars.
## Hacked the Minnesotta state database and got all the epic passwords!!
Doing `grep "mn.us" *.txt` on Collection #1 is not hacking, it's being stupid, leeching and taking credit for other people's hard hax0ring.

This article will update sooner or later.
