Reitberg was the Chief Operating Officer of Escobar Inc and got to meet Roberto Escobar in Columbia a number of times.

Reitberg was sued by Escobar Inc. for siphoning funds, holding their YouTube account under Ransom and extortion attempts. Reitberg left Escobar Inc. around the time where they made the Escobar Fold II, a gold-skinned Samsung Galaxy Fold.
