# There's Anonymous stans and my sanity is now Game Over

Last time that we reported on Anonymous, we slightly made fun of them. This is going to be a bit more than that.
After the series of unlawful annoyances that members of Anonymous perpetrated on law enforcement websites, a herd of mostly pre-pubecent girls decided to form a stan group -- more commonly known as a "standom" for Anonymous.
It may sound ridiculous, because it is. It's sexualized, like everything on the Internet. An Anonymous account claims to have recieved nudes from these stans, that account later got canceled for being Transphobic, perhaps more members will get canceled when a JIKNEWS article will release...
This article is short, like the lifespan of this standom.
