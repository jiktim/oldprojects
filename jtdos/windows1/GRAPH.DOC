MICROSOFT Windows Application Mockups: Chart & Graph


Disclaimer: no warranty is made or implied about the correctness
of this documentation or the code it describes.  These are mockups
of possible user interfaces and implementation techniques and do
NOT represent any commitment on the part of MICROSOFT to
produce and/or deliver products and applications that use these
models.


This document is a brief description of two application mockups for the
MICROSOFT Windows environment.

Each top level window instance contains children windows that display
either a figure or a data set.  The data sets do NOT determine the shape of
the figure.

Graph is an overlapping child model.  It also is a test bed for some user
interface and debugging experiments.


GRAPH

The figure may be moved using mouse button 1.  The figure may be
stretched by pointing near the rectangle enclosing it and using button 1.

The figure window and the data set windows may be moved using control
plus mouse button 1 or mouse button 2.  The figure window and data set
windows may be stretched by pointing near their edges and using control
plus mouse button 1 or mouse button 2.

The GALLERY menu allows the form of the figure to be changed.

The number of bars may be changed using the DATA menu, or the dialog box
displayed from the SIZE menu or by typing "+" or "-" after clicking in the
figure window.

If the property SCALE is set, then the size of the figure is determined by its
enclosing window.

THe debug menu toggles the display of 5 small text display menus that are
used for debugging.  There is also a debug dialog box with more extensive
options.


CHART

The figure window is the size of the top level window.

There is a vetical split bar in the lower scroll bar.  Drag this spliter bar
horizontally to expose a column that displays data sets.  Drag all the way to
the right to remove data set display.

With data sets displayed, horizontal splitter bars in the right scroll bar
allow the size of the data sets to be changed.  Dragging the topmost splitter
bar will expose new data sets.

Bug: the mouse is NOT tracked outside the CHART window.  So the mouse must
be dragged within the window and released within the window for the
events to be noticed.
