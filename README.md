### Discord API
Projects that primarily interacted with the Discord API.
  
Chiibiki (Hibiki): @chiibiki's Discord bot from 2017-2018. Not to be confused with the current Hibiki project as they're seperate entities. Related to Ram.
  
Chino: The original version of the Hibiki project from late 2018 to early 2019.

Diseperation: View an entire tree of your Discord friends list, going as far back as possible. Created by @alecks and @cthpw103. Killed due to API limits.

EW1Bot: A Discord bot for the electronicwiz1 Discord server in 2016. Based on an old version of TT.bot or FireBot, probably. Very early and broken code.

FireBot: Jiktim's first public and successful Discord bot. At it's peak in 2016/2017, it was in over 10000 servers. Killed off due to token exploitation.

Hibiki (v2): Version 2.0 of the Hibiki project. Succeeds Chino and was updated until April 2020.

HuskyBot (v1 & v2): A Discord bot originally "written" by Jj The Husky, albeit it is based on TT.bot and EW1Bot code, so it is still a jiktim project. Succeeded by a GAwesomeBot clone that got killed some time in 2017. 

jAuth: A Discord bot that could manage your 2FA-enabled accounts. Yes, it's stupid. Yes, it's insecure. Did we care? No. Killed off due to lack of interest.

jDump (v1): A CLI(?) utility to convert Discord messages in selected servers to plaintext. Killed off due to lack of interest. However, we are interested in a reboot.

JikPizza: A Discord bot that reverse engineered the Dominos Pizza API to order pizza thru Discord. Killed off due to lack of interest. However, we are interested in a reboot.

Megumin: The Discord bot that succeded FireBot and Nep in 2018. Killed off due to disinterest and anger. Succeded by Chino, Hibiki (v2), and the Hibiki project.

Megumin (Sol's Megumin): The Discord bot that predates Ram but also co-existed with Sol's Hibiki...christ.

Nep: The succesor to FireBot in 2017. Lasted a whopping 9 days until it was renamed to Megumin.

Ram: The succesor to Chi's Hibiki in October 2018. Killed off due to lack of interest.
